small-budget
============

Simple budget program, written in Python3.

I found very similar code of this program in many websites, so I cannot point the original author.

I have rewritten the code in python 3 standards and simplified the program. I will add more functionality to it and try to make a GUI.

Please view the RELEASES tab, because the code in main repository is only for test purposes.

I am newbie in python so any help is appreciated.
